# Summary of Key Themes from Product Sketches

# Data Wedge
* Inventory management tool for small-scale vendors eases friction of collecting transaction data and creates “pull” for users to digitize financial information
* Sources of data that may imply spending / saving / sales:
* * Government
* Aggregated:
* * Banks
* * Lenders
* * Billers
* * Telcos
* * Insurance
* Consumers are given identity by combining 2 elements:
* * Universal ID
* * Public ledger of transaction (financial identity)
* Tracking cash transactions and linking with ID
* Using non-transactional data (utility payments, cell phone usage, value of assets) to assess user's risk to banks/ insurers/ investors

Education/ Advertising Wedge
Financial health education program - Instructor-based financial education platform to educate participants with challenging financial health
Program with classes, speakers, and exercises to help users maintain and sustain positive financial health
Upon completion of program/certificate - a small line of credit will be given to participants to begin building credit history for inclusion into the large banking system
Participants will have a personal tracking mechanism to see the progress that is needed to obtain basic line of credit
Apprenticeship for financial health
Shift from course to apprenticeship style → from learning then doing to learning by doing.
Mentors (or bots) guide users to improve real-life financial outcomes
Learn about insurance by being guided through your first insurance purchase, etc.

Brokerage/ Formalization Wedge
Interface between community saving pools and bank/fincos
Banks offer incentives (insurance, loans) for reaching savings milestones
Determine optimal use of resources (i.e. cash, land, etc) and suggest investment strategy implementable with one click (insurance, forward sales, crop type, etc)
What should I buy to maximise my risk weighted return?
Automate process for purchase, forward sale, insurance all through digital broker

User Interface Ideas
Gamification of financial health encourages positive behavior
Creditometer
Visualizing community money pool
Nudges encourage users to:
Verify & reflect on daily spending
Save and control spending with social comparisons to rest of community
