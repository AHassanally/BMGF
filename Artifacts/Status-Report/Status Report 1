Hi Dave

By way of background, this email is the first of a series of weekly updates to keep you posted on our progress and plans in this project.  We'd be grateful if you could cast your eye over these emails as they come through, and let us know if we are falling off track.

## This week we:
   
* discussed the challenge ahead of us, to try to understand: (1) the scope of the problem and (2) our assumptions in relation to the user-base and the system in which the problem exists;
* learned about our team, and the relative strengths of each member;
* reached out to you, and planned a meeting for next week;
* created a system diagram of the challenge ecosystem; 
* defined "wedges", or relative advantages, that might differentiate our products from others on the market; and
* set up the github page for our company challenge "artifacts".

## Next week, we will:

* discuss our challenge with you in greater depth, including: (1) testing our system diagram and wedges with you; (2) testing our assumptions with you, and (3) discussing how better to learn about our target market with you;
* rebuild our system diagram and rethink our wedges in light of our discussions with you;
* do a market study: what are other for-profit and non-profit entities doing in the cash-economy finance space; and
* ascertain what resources might be available to us, and reach out to those resources, especially in respect of consumer research, which may be time intensive and logistically difficult.

## Challenges:

* There is an inherent challenge in working with a non-cash economy, in that we are not certain of the motivations and bounds of the participants in that economy. We run the risk of making incorrect assumptions about the participants if we do not engage in adequate consumer research (or do not analyse a third party's research in that area sufficiently). 
* Financial services, especially consumer services, and especially in relation to the poor, are heavily regulated. As such, we must ensure that our solution falls ourside of, or complies with, any regulation, as well as considers the political sensitivities around the challenge.
* The above will require that, early on in the product lifecycle, we conduct a thorough consumer analysis and regulatory review.


Thanks and kind regards, and looking forward to our discussion this week.

Have a good labour day long weekend
